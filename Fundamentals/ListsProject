# This code is a practice project to work with lists. Several step by step instructions were given to create and modify a list of mock-classes and mock-grades

# last_semester_gradebook was given as part of the project example
last_semester_gradebook = [["politics", 80], ["latin", 96], ["dance", 97], ["architecture", 65]]

# My code below: 
# create list of subjects
subjects = ["physics", "calculus", "poetry", "history"]
# create list of grades
grades = [98, 97, 85, 88]
# manually create a combined list (two-dimensional list) of subjects and grades
gradebook = [["physics", 98], ["calculus", 97], ["poetry", 85], ["history", 88]]

# appending classes and grades to my existing list
gradebook.append(["computer science", 100])
gradebook.append(["visual arts", 93])
# modify the visual arts grade from 93 to 98
gradebook[5][1] = 98

# Switch poetry grade to a simple "pass/fail" grading system. Remove number grade and add a "Pass" instead.
gradebook[2].remove(85)
gradebook[2].append("Pass")

# combine both gradebooks together to create final_gradebook
full_gradebook = gradebook + last_semester_gradebook
print(full_gradebook)
