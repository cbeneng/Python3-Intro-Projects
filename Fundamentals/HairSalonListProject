# Sample project for Hair Salon Business. This project is practice to work with lists in a real setting.

# Given data and variables, hairstyles, prices, last_week
hairstyles = ["bouffant", "pixie", "dreadlocks", "crew", "bowl", "bob", "mohawk", "flattop"]

prices = [30, 25, 40, 20, 20, 35, 50, 35]

last_week = [2, 3, 5, 8, 4, 4, 6, 2]

# Set my own variables that I will use throughout the project
total_price = 0
new_total_price = 0
number_of_haircuts = len(hairstyles)
total_revenue = 0

# Use for-loop to get total price of all haircuts, and then average it
for price in prices:
  total_price += price
print("Total Price of All Haircuts: $" + str(total_price)  )
average_price = total_price / number_of_haircuts
print("Average Price of All Haircuts: $" + str(average_price))

# Hair Salon owner wants to reduce cost of all haircuts by $5. Use list comprehension to subtract 5 from all values in list prices
new_prices = [new_price - 5 for new_price in prices]
print("List of new prices after $5 off: " + str(new_prices))

# Use for-loop to get total price of all haircuts after the $5 discount, and then average it
for price in new_prices:
  new_total_price += price
print("New Total Price of All Haircuts: $" + str(new_total_price)  )
new_average_price = new_total_price / number_of_haircuts
print("New Average Price of All Haircuts: $" + str(new_average_price))

# Revenue
# Use for-loop to calculate revenue of last_week
for i in range(number_of_haircuts):
  total_revenue += last_week[i] * prices[i]
print("Last week's revenue: $" + str(total_revenue))

# Average out the revenue over past 7 days
average_daily_revenue = total_revenue / 7
print("Average daily revenue: $" + str(average_daily_revenue))

# List Comprehension for Hair Salon owner to advertise all haircuts under $30

cuts_under_30 = [hairstyles[cheap] for cheap in range(number_of_haircuts) if new_prices[cheap] < 30]
